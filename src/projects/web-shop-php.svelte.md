## Context

This project was created as part of the 'Web Development' module at Reutlingen University during my time studying abroad.

I worked on this project in a team of two, with my colleague being responsible for the backend and me being responsible for the frontend.

## Final Product

The following video demonstrates the key functionality of the website, as well as going through all of the pages to show what they look like.
