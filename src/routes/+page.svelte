   <p>Throughout my studies, personal projects and work, I have developed a strong understanding in programming languages such as: </p>

   <p>Throughout this website you will find a selection of my projects and experiences that showcase my skills and interest in Software Development. Each project demonstrates my ability to learn quickly, solve problems and develop high-quality code.</p>
